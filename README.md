# loc-graph-action
GitHub Action that analyzes your repositoryâ€™s commit history, counts lines of code (LOC) for each commit, and generates an SVG chart showing LOC changes over time. The chart is automatically committed back to the repository, so you can embed it directly in your README or documentation.
